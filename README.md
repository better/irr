This repo contains a custom implementation of `numpy.irr` built from scratch. It is used to compute the [internal rate of return](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_rate_of_return), also called APR, which is useful in a wide range of financial circumstances.

What's wrong with `numpy.irr`? It's extremely slow and usually returns `nan`.

Installing
==========

The easiest way to install is probably to run this:

```
pip install -e git://github.com/better/irr#egg=irr
```

More info
=========

There are two implementations available in this package. `irr.irr` defaults to `irr.irr_binary_search` which is slower but more stable. There is also `irr.irr_newton` which is much faster but sometimes doesn't converge.
